# GBHD-Advance-SP-Case

This case does require 3x threaded inserts which can be found on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/M2x4-0mm-OD3-6mm-Staking-Threaded-Inserts/dp/B08T7NDPQC/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=m2+threaded+insert&qid=1668797489&sprefix=m2+threade%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-11). The threaded inserts can melted into the top case with a soldering iron. Using the tip of the iron, press the insert into 3 holes that align with the SP mounting holes.
